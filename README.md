To compile our code, simply have the five files in the desired directory:  
    EDAmain.cpp  
    MDAmain.cpp  
    Qmain.cpp  
    Makefile  
    README.md  

Then run the command:  
    make

To run our code, simply run the desired command:  
    ./EDAmain   // runs A* with euclidean distance  
    ./MDAmain   // runs A* with manhattan distance  
    ./Qmain     // runs Q-learning  

To clean your directory after running you can run the command:  
    make clean  

To exit early you can press  
    control + 'c'
