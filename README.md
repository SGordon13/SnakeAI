To compile our code, simply have the five files in the desired directory:  
&emsp;    EDAmain.cpp  
&emsp;    MDAmain.cpp  
&emsp;    Qmain.cpp  
&emsp;    Makefile  
&emsp;    README.md  

Then run the command:  
&emsp;    Make

To run our code, simply run the desired command:  
&emsp;    ./EDAmain   // runs A* with euclidean distance  
&emsp;    ./MDAmain   // runs A* with manhattan distance  
&emsp;    ./Qmain     // runs Q-learning  

To clean your directory after running you can run the command:  
&emsp;    Make clean  

To exit early you can press  
&emsp;    control + 'c'
